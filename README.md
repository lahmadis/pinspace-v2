- **Studios** (Individual sections)

### 3. 3D Studio Room ⭐ **THE MAGIC HAPPENS HERE**
Walk through a virtual critique space:
- **Orbit**: Click & drag to look around
- **Zoom**: Scroll wheel
- **Select**: Click boards to view details
- **Reset**: Press R or click Reset View button
- **Back**: Press ESC or click back arrow

### 4. Board Detail

## What's Special

### The 3D Room Innovation
Instead of scrolling through a flat grid, you **walk through a studio space** with boards on walls - just like a real architecture critique.

**This solves:**
- ✅ Group grading (faculty see all work at once)
- ✅ Spatial context (boards in relation to each other)
- ✅ Engagement (interactive exploration)
- ✅ Memory (distinctive interface)

### Professional Quality
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Responsive design
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Clean aesthetics

### Ready to Expand
- Foundation for live critique
- Upload system ready to add
- Database integration planned
- Multi-user features designed
